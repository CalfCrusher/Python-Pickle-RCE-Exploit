# Python-Pickle-RCE-Exploit
A simple RCE Pickle PoC with a vulnerable Flask App

In Python, the pickle module lets you serialize and deserialize data. Essentially, this means that you can convert a Python object into a stream of bytes and then reconstruct it (including the objectâ€™s internal structure) later in a different process or environment by loading that stream of bytes (for further info checkout this: https://davidhamann.de/2020/04/05/exploiting-python-pickle/

## Setting up vulnerable Flask app (app.py)

$ virtualenv venv --python=/your/path/to/python

$ source venv/bin/activate

$ pip install Flask

$ flask run

## Exploit Pickle RCE (Pickle-PoC.py)

$ python Pickle-PoC.py [URL]

## Exploit Pickle RCE PoC for THM Owasp10 Room (THM_pickle_owasp10_room.py)
